### Project Description: Voice-Controlled AI Assistant "Frank"

This project is a voice-controlled AI assistant named "Frank," designed to assist users with various tasks using speech recognition, OpenAI's GPT-3, and other utilities. The assistant can respond to voice commands, perform web searches, open applications, manage files, and more. Key features include:

1. **Voice Interaction**:
   - Uses `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech, allowing Frank to speak responses.
   - Utilizes `speech_recognition` to process and recognize voice commands.

2. **Chatbot Functionality**:
   - Integrates OpenAI's GPT-3 (`text-davinci-003`) to generate human-like responses and save them to files for record-keeping.
   - Maintains a conversation history for context.

3. **Task Automation**:
   - Opens default software like Calculator, File Manager, Notepad, etc., upon command.
   - Accesses basic websites such as YouTube, Google, and Facebook.
   - Captures photos using the device's camera.
   - Manages system functions such as hibernation, location searches, and system shutdowns.

4. **File Management**:
   - Creates and manages a directory to store AI responses to various prompts.

5. **Voice Command Handling**:
   - Processes commands to perform actions such as locking the screen, stopping listening temporarily, or shutting down the system.
   - Gracefully exits when given specific commands like "bye" or "exit."

6. **Continuous Listening Loop**:
   - Continuously listens for commands in an infinite loop, providing real-time assistance.

The project showcases the integration of voice recognition, AI-powered responses, and system automation, making it a versatile tool for various everyday tasks.
